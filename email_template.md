Dear <<Colleagues>>,

<<TEST01>>

Thank you again for attending the **PNWHEIA 2025 Conference**, hosted by the University of Washington. We appreciate your participation and the valuable insights you brought to the event.

As we move forward with finalizing billing, our President’s Office will be handling invoice processing. To ensure accuracy and timely delivery, we kindly request the following billing details for <<University>>:

* University **EIN/Tax ID**
* Preferred **method of invoice delivery** (Mail, Email, or Both)
* Invoice **delivery address** (We can include an “ATTN” line to direct it to your Internal Audit department)
* Primary **customer contact** information: Name, Phone number, Email address

Please send this information at your earliest convenience to help us complete the billing process smoothly.

As a reminder, we shall bill **$125 for each person** from your institution that attended. I have your institution listed as sending **<<Count>>** <<Attendees>> for an estimate of **<<Money>>**.

Also, a sincere thank you to everyone who has already completed the [follow-up survey](https://forms.office.com/r/KaBSDagh8B) — your feedback is incredibly valuable and appreciated.

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.

Sincerely,

**Brian Danford**  
Program Coordinator, UW Internal Audit
